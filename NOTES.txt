To get the GUI running on your machine take these steps:

1) Download Javafx SDK. It should look like this javafx-sdk-22
2) In VSCode, at the bottom left of the window you should see "JAVA PROJECTS", and underneath that there
should be a side bar named "Referenced Libraries", click on the plus and add all the Jar files that are in your
javafx-sdk-22 folder. It should be located in the lib directory. Add all of the Jar files.

If this doesn't work. Look at how I did it under the settings.json file.
Ex:
{
    "java.project.sourcePaths": ["src"],
    "java.project.outputPath": "bin",
    "java.project.referencedLibraries": [
        "lib/**/*.jar",

        "/Users/paulinerosales/Desktop/javafx-sdk-22/lib/**/*.jar"
    ]
}

Might need to add your pathway under referencedLibraries in both settings.json in the NMSUEZPARKING project directory and outside of it
in the repo. VSCode randomly put the .vscode outside of the directory for some unknown reason.

3) Under .vscode look for launch.json. You need to add "VmArgs": and copy and paste 

FOR LINUX AND MAC
"vmArgs": "--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-22/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"

FOR WINDOWS
"vmArgs": "--module-path "/path/to/javafx-sdk-22/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"

Where the path is the path to your javafx-sdk-22/lib directory.

Instead of where my vmArgs are, replace this with yours.
